# sdc--Monocular-3D-Object-Detection
Abstract—Monocular object detection offers advantages overstereo-based and LiDAR-based methods for autonomous driving applications, such as simple design, low cost, and lower power requirement. MonoCon is a highly accurate and fast monocular 3D object detection method without requiring additional data like depth or LiDAR. It utilizes auxiliary monocular contexts during training and achieves leading results, particularly in detecting cars, in the KITTI benchmark. We propose finetuning techniques for enhancing MonoCon’s performance in hazy environmental conditions. We replaced the original cyclic learning rate scheduler with the OneCycleLR method for adjusting the learning rate while training. We also augment the original KITTI data by adding a fog-like effect to increase the robustness of the fine-tuned model. We evaluate the model’s performance in adverse weather conditions.
